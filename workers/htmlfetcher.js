// Use the code in `archive-helpers.js` to actually download the urls
// that are waiting.

// our worker will go down the list of archive helper methods in order
// readListOfUrls
// isUrlInList
// addUrlToList
// isUrlArchived
// downloadUrls

// these are probably going to be async so be careful

// and it will do it on a set schedule set by cron

// we need to download actual html files from the internet
